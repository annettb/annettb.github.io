            <p class="lead"> As a flutter engineer I verify that all feasible aircraft configurations are flutter free throughout the flight envelope. Conduct aeroelastic and aerosevoelastic analyses, document requirements, document results for certification, and conduct full scale flight test for Boeing Commercial Aircraft.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>737MAX-7-responsible for flutter certification analysis and for coordinating and writing the certification document. Responsible for coordinating and executing flutter flight test. Defined instrumentation requirements, modal analysis tools, staffing needs, and condition sequence for flight flutter testing. Tested and validated the modal analysis tools, and verified all instrumentation installed correctly. Created a tool to calculate closed loop stability margins during real time testing. Received an employee of the month award for Loads and Dynamics for significantly reducing the data reduction time. </li>
              <li>737MAX-9- Created flight test model, ran predictions, and provided damping calculations during testing. Once testing was complete I collaborated with our FAA authorized representative to determine requirements to show compliance in the experimental certification document. Went through the post test data processing and wrote the final experimental certification document.

            <ul>
              <li>KC-46 Tanker- developed a means of predicting the buffet loads by using historical test data that eliminated the need for error prone instrumentation. This saved the airplane from needing to return home for instrumentation repairs. In addition, I developed an onboard loads analysis tool to minimize the time and resources needed to disposition exceedences during testing. </li>
              <li>777X - worked on dynamic and static ground loads analysis for all segments of ground operation. The work included model build, analysis setup, surveying, defining the critical ultimate and fatigue loads, and documentation. </li>

            <ul>
              <li>Research and Development, Aerodynamics-Designed and tested a unique drag savings vortex generator which was filed by Boeing for a US patent in 2014</li> <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/EP2998219A1/ja">EP2998219A1</a>
              <li>Research and Development, Composites-Designed and tested a Non-Destructive Inspection apparatus for measuring in-plane engineering elastic constants for composite plates. The apparatus was designed to help measure the stiffness of production composite repairs. </li>
              <li>Requirements Development, Composites-Defined testing and analysis requirements for a newly designed composite repair patch. Worked with an FAA Authorized representative and the Methods and Allowables group to define the additional capabilities needed in the current analysis tools for the new patch. </li>
              <li>Production Support, Liaison- Worked as a liaison engineer supporting the 737 factory, flightline, and delivery center. As a liaison engineer, I was responsible for dispositioning non conforming structure and systems to restoring them to their original design capability.</li>
              <li>Post Production support,Field Service-Worked as an on onsite Boeing Field Service representative at Narita and Haneda Airport. Worked closely with our customers to coordinate repairs to in-service issues.</li> </ul>
